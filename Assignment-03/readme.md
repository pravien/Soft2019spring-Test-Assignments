# Assignment 3

1. Write a program where you illustrate what non-testable code could look like. Make sure to include
some code smells that you can refactor away later.

2. Use a tool to automatically check for code smells, e.g. CheckStyle and FindBugs for Java. You can
use JaCoCo to calculate Cyclomatic Complexity. Document the result.

3. Rewrite the program with testability in mind and write automated unit tests for the program.

4. Use the same tool(s) as in 2) to automatically check your code again. Document the result
